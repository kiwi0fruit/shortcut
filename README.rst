Shortcutter ========

|Latest Version| |Docs|

Shortcutter is a cross platform command line application and API for
creating shortcuts.

``shortcutter`` will do its best to find your app, searching for the
usual suspects in the usual places (i.e.Â those in the PATH), or you can
give it a full path.

To create desktop and menu shortcuts for ``python``:

-  Using the app:

   ::

       shortcutter python

-  Using the Python API:

   .. code:: py

       from shortcutter import ShortCutter
       s = ShortCutter()
       s.create_desktop_shortcut("python")
       s.create_menu_shortcut("python")

It was created to solve a simple problem - if you install a python
package using ``pip`` there is no simple way of creating a shortcut to
the program it installs.
